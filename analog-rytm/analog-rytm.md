# Analog RYTM
TODO: Move these into individual sections once some logical categories naturally emerge.

## Time Stretch
For this example: 16 step pattern, 1 page.
- Choose a track on RYTM and set a sample.
- Create a trig on 1, turn retrig on for that trig, set length to 16, rate to 1/32, velocity to -128.
- Turn velocity up to 128 on the trig page.
- Tap FUNC+FLTR to access settings, turn off Velocity To Volume, enter Velocity Mod Setup page. Select Sample Start as the destination and set the depth to -120.
- Go to the sample page and move the sample start point to 119.
## Filter Keytracking
In Velocity Mod, there is a setting in order to have 1 velocity value = 1 semitone. This may vary depending on the chosen synth machine / calibration. It's not perfect.
- Velocity Mod Page: Destination = Filter Frequency, Depth = 125
- Filter Page: Bandpass, Freq = 0, high Resonance.
- Play a tuned sample.
- Find the fundamental of your choice.
- Parameter-lock the velocity.
- Apply a Square LFO with depth = +12 (1 octave up / down).
