Welcome to the Intermediate Beats Analog RYTM pages.

TODO: Move these into individual sections once some logical categories naturally emerge.

## Time Stretch
- For this example: 16 step pattern, 1 page.
- Choose a track on RYTM and set a sample.
- Create a trig on 1, turn retrig on for that trig, set length to 16, rate to 1/32, velocity to -128.
- Turn velocity up to 128 on the trig page
- Tap FUNC+FLTR to access settings, turn off Velocity To Volume, enter Velocity Mod Setup page. Select Sample Start as the destination and set the depth to -120.
- Go to the sample page and move the sample start point to 119.
